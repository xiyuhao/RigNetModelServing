def cross_entropy_with_probs_snorkel(input, target, weight=None, reduction="mean"):
    """Calculate cross-entropy loss when targets are probabilities (floats), not ints.
    PyTorch's F.cross_entropy() method requires integer labels; it does accept
    probabilistic labels. We can, however, simulate such functionality with a for loop,
    calculating the loss contributed by each class and accumulating the results.
    Libraries such as keras do not require this workaround, as methods like
    "categorical_crossentropy" accept float labels natively.
    Note that the method signature is intentionally very similar to F.cross_entropy()
    so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement when target labels are changed from
    from a 1D tensor of ints to a 2D tensor of probabilities.
    Parameters
    ----------
    input
        A [num_points, num_classes] tensor of logits
    target
        A [num_points, num_classes] tensor of probabilistic target labels
    weight
        An optional [num_classes] array of weights to multiply the loss by per class
    reduction
        One of "none", "mean", "sum", indicating whether to return one loss per data
        point, the mean loss, or the sum of losses
    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The calculated loss
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
